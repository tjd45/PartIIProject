# PartIIProject
Third year project at the University of Cambridge comparing search based methods and a machine learning approach to solving a Rubik's cube

Basic idea of my project is to investigate the performance of a couple of different search based solutions to solving a rubik's cube as well as looking to see if I can successfully implement a machine learnign approach to 'learn' how to solve the cube from increasing numbers of moves away. I am also looking to implement at first a basic gui and then potentially a more complex one to allow for visualisation of this solving.
